# Realtime Markdown Editor

### What is this?

Type your markdown into the box on the left and immediately see if on the box on the right. If you send a friend a link to this URL you both can edit the document at the same time!

### How to use this?

Type anything after the slash in "https://rt-markdown.herokuapp.com/" and just start typing. If you don't feel typing in the address bar, feel free to go to one of these markdown pads:

- [https://rt-markdown.herokuapp.com/sample](https://rt-markdown.herokuapp.com/sample)
- [https://rt-markdown.herokuapp.com/my_project](https://rt-markdown.herokuapp.com/my_project)
- [https://rt-markdown.herokuapp.com/whatever](https://rt-markdown.herokuapp.com/whatever)
